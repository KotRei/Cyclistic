# How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

This a capstone project for completing Google Data Analytics certificate. For this project I am assuming the role of junior data analyst in a fictional bike-sharing company Cyclistic.

## About Cyclistic

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
Context
Cyclistic is already well-known for it’s flexibity of the pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.  Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. The director of marketing has set a goal to convert casual riders into annual members. 

### Key Stakeholders

#### Lily Moreno
The director of marketing. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. 

#### Cyclistic marketing analytics team 
A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy
Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

### Business Task

The goal of this project is to answer the question: *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?* and provide recommendations for designing a new marketing strategy.

### Data Sources

This project uses Cyclistic clients’ historical data from 2021 June to 2022 May. It is first-party data, i.e. it was collected by the company directly from the clients. Datasets can be found [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under [this license](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

### Data Cleaning

For this part of the project I used RStudio.


``` 
##First I install & load the packages needed for the project

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("lubridate")
install.packages("janitor")

library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
library("janitor")

##Then I import the files

jun_21 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202106-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jul_21 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202107-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug_21 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202108-divvy-tripdata.csv") 
sep_21 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202109-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct_21 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202110-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov_21 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202111-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec_21 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202112-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jan_22 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb_22 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar_22 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr_22 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may_22 <- read_csv("~/RStudio/202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")



##Comparing data frames in a list to see if bindable

compare_df_cols_same(
  jun_21, jul_21, aug_21, sep_21, oct_21, nov_21, dec_21, jan_22, feb_22, 
  mar_22, apr_22, may_22,
  bind_method = c("bind_rows", "rbind"),
  verbose = TRUE
)

##Binding of the data frames

data_jun_21_may_22 <- rbind(jun_21, jul_21, aug_21, sep_21, oct_21, nov_21, dec_21, 
                    jan_22, feb_22, mar_22, apr_22, may_22)

##Renaming columns for readability

data_jun_21_may_22_2 <- rename(data_jun_21_may_22, start_full_date = started_at, end_full_date = ended_at)

##Deleting duplicate rows, if any, and NA values

data_jun_21_may_22_3 <- data_jun_21_may_22_2 %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  na.omit(all_months)

##Deleting columns unnecessary for the analysis

data_jun_21_may_22_3[ , c('start_lat', 'start_lng', 'end_lat', 'end_lng')] <- list(NULL)

##Separate start_full_date column into start_date, start_month and start_hour columns. Remove leading zeroes from start_hour column

data_jun_21_may_22_4 <- data_jun_21_may_22_3
data_jun_21_may_22_4$start_date <- format(as.POSIXct(data_jun_21_may_22_3$start_full_date,format="%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S"),"%Y-%m-%d")
data_jun_21_may_22_4$start_month <- format(as.POSIXct(data_jun_21_may_22_3$start_full_date,format="%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S"),"%h")
data_jun_21_may_22_4$start_hour <- sub("^0", "", format(as.POSIXct(data_jun_21_may_22_3$start_full_date,format="%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S"),"%H"))

##Create weekday column

data_jun_21_may_22_4$start_weekday <- wday(data_jun_21_may_22_4$start_full_date, label=TRUE, abbr=FALSE)

##Create ride_duration column

data_jun_21_may_22_5 <- data_jun_21_may_22_4 %>% 
  mutate(ride_duration = as.integer(difftime(end_full_date, start_full_date, units = "mins")))
View(data_jun_21_may_22_5)

##Sorting data by ride duration - checking for outliers

newdata <- data_jun_21_may_22_5[order(data_jun_21_may_22_5$ride_duration),]
View(newdata)

newdata_2 <- data_jun_21_may_22_5[order(data_jun_21_may_22_5$ride_duration, decreasing = TRUE),]
View(newdata_2)

##Removing rows where ride duration is equal to or less than zero

newdata_3 <- subset(data_jun_21_may_22_5, ride_duration > 0)
View(newdata_3)

final_data <- newdata_3[order(final_data$ride_duration),]
View(final_data)

##Export data frame as .csv file

write.csv(final_data, "C:\\Users\\User\\Desktop\\final_data.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

### Data Analysis

For visualization I have to decided to use Tableau.

### Insights into data:

* Casual riders execute more rides on weekends than work days. They tend to go for longer rides, seemingly for leisure.
* Members go for shorter rides, mostly during work days. Also, they ride more during cooler months than casual riders, most likely for commuting.
* Casual members ride most from May to September.

### Recommendations:

* Launch a marketing campaign from May to September.
* Offer weekend or longer rides passes for casual riders.
* Introduce more benefits for member riders.
